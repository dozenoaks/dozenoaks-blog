      <description>I moved my blog! Not just in terms of where it’s hosted, but how the whole thing is built. Previously I’d been using ghost, which was fine up until the moment I wanted to publish more code/analysis. The process of copy-pasting code and exporting images was taking more time than writing the code itself.
I’m now using the blogdown package which builds static websites within RStudio using Hugo and lets you publish the results.</description>
