      <description>This post deals with something niche but practical - getting ggplot2 to plot multiple fitted gaussians from a model with different amplitudes. Google failed to provide the answer I was looking for - if you canâ€™t find it with Google, it must need a blog post.
We have a couple of different projects running at the moment that need us to think about mixture models - these are common in single molecule biophysics work as you frequently end up with two or more populations of molecules stretched out along a continuous variable; could be velocity, step size or something else.</description>
