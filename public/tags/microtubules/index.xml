      <description>When I was on the microscope imaging EB3 comets in axons as a control experiment for a control experiment, I got distracted by the comets in the dendrites - so pretty! They reminded me of the icicle lights on the outside of people&amp;rsquo;s houses you see this time of year. So this is my science Christmas card to you - have a Merry one :)</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime ago I got recruited by Jake to help him come up with a summary figure for his paper on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001611&#34;&gt;p150 and microtubule catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;. I place high scientific value on well designed descriptive schematics that help you visualise and explain the process your trying to describe, so I took the task on and decided to use it as an opportunity to build myself a decent microtubule model for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
