      <description>We have a couple of different projects running at the moment that need us to think about mixture models - these are common in single molecule biophysics work as you frequently end up with two or more populations of molecules stretched out along a continuous variable; could be velocity, step size or something else. A common solution to figuring out what the typical representative values are in the mixed population is to fit multiple gaussians to the data and describe the mean and standard deviation of each.</description>

      <description>I have a bit of a love hate relationship with kymographs. In the way that they compress data thereâ€™s no doubt that you loose information, but in the world of axonal transport and low signal:noise they have clear advantages in enabling quantification.
I covered before a couple of strategies you can use to import image data into R. The next step in my workflow is usually to turn that image into a data table for further analysis.</description>
