In May my
[paper](http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(16)30160-X?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS089662731630160X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)
was finally released into the wild. Amongst other things it was the culmination 
of 4 years of me learning to use R for data analysis (and in my case data = 
images of cells). I've been meaning to blog some of this for a while, but I will
try for my own sanity to keep everything in bite size chunks. Starting at the 
start: data import.

## tiff : Read and write TIFF images

Up until this point I've only had need to 'port single plane .tif images of 
kymographs (of which, more later) generated in [FIJI](http://fiji.sc) into R. 

![](/img/kymo_screen_shot.png)

For this purpose, the ['tiff' package on 
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tiff/index.html) is more than 
adequate: it has two very straight forward functions, `readTIFF` and 
`writeTIFF`. It can handle 8-bit, 16-bit integer and 32-bit float samples (great
because my kymograph workflow culminates in a 32-bit float). Reading in a single
plane image creates a matrix. Reading in multiple channels creates an array.
The 'tiff' package can handle up to 4 channels (no z and t), so it is limited for
scientific image purposes, but small and simple has it's advatages too. 

```{r read tiff, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tiff)
kymo <- readTIFF("MAX_Reslice_of_low_pass_axon_16bit.tif")

dim(kymo) #dimensions of the matrix, original image was 951 x 181 pixels

min(kymo) #minimum value of the matrix, B&C ImageJ viewer said 468.65

max(kymo) #maximum value of the matrix, B&C ImageJ viewer said 1433.88

kymo[1:5, 1:6] #display the first five rows and the first six columns of data

image(kymo) #quick auto display of the image data
```

So that was easy! The power of R is now at your disposal. As a side note, the
.tif file on my hard drive was 692kb, whilst the matrix is 1.3 Mb. There are
also the equivalent packages for 'jpeg' and 'png' image formats.

## EBImage : Image processing and analysis toolbox for R

['EBImage'](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html) is 
a package avaiable on [bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org). Essentially 
it wraps up the 'tiff', 'jpeg' and 'png' packages and extends them to provide 
better functionality for more complex image processing and analysis tasks. There
is a really great (recent) [vignette for
EBImage](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/EBImage/inst/doc/EBImage-introduction.html),
so I won't repeat too much here. It creates it's own class, Image, to store and
process images. One part of this is the same array you get with the 'tiff'
package. The other part is a list of attributes describing your image, which are
much better at handling z and t stacks than the 'tiff' package. One thing I will
say is that the display options can't handle 32bit images, however you'll also
notice that it automatically corrects the display oddities that happen with just
the raw array. (You can install `EBImage` by installing bioconductor with `source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")` followed by installing `EBImage` with
`biocLite("EBImage")`)

```{r ebimage}
library("EBImage")

kymo2 <- readImage("MAX_Reslice_of_low_pass_axon_16bit.tif")

kymo2

display(kymo2, method = "raster") # setting method = "raster" previews images inside Rstudio, rather than in the interactive browser viewer
```

## Other good stuff
### RBioFormats

So as I was browsing the new [EBImage
vignette](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/EBImage/inst/doc/EBImage-introduction.html)
the other day (prompted by 
[Steve Royal's](https://twitter.com/clathrin?lang=en-gb) tweet, I love 
sci-twitter), I discovered something that pretty much made my day. There is an 
[R interface to the Bio-Formats library on
Github](https://github.com/aoles/RBioFormats). I had no idea such a thing
existed! I am now hankering after the day I can use this in a project. No more
batch import/export in ImageJ!

### imager : Image Processing Library Based on 'CImg'

Before I go, to be completist, I also wanted to point to the 
['imager'](http://dahtah.github.io/imager/) package. This is authered by [Simon
BarthelmÃ©](https://sites.google.com/site/simonbarthelme/), a CNRS researcher at
Gipsa-lab, Grenoble. There's a version on 
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/index.html), a 
[develpoment version on GitHub](https://github.com/dahtah/imager), and quite a 
few [useful vignettes](http://dahtah.github.io/imager/) available. Worth a look.
