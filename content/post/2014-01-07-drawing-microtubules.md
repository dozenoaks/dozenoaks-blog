Sometime ago I got recruited by Jake to help him come up with a summary figure for his paper on [p150 and microtubule catastrophe](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001611). I place high scientific value on well designed descriptive schematics that help you visualise and explain the process your trying to describe, so I took the task on and decided to use it as an opportunity to build myself a decent microtubule model for later use.  

<!--more-->

It’s fairly standard to model the tubulin monomer as a sphere and this is the microtubule I came up with:

The eagle eyed cytoskeleton enthusiast might notice a glaring error in this model - an error that was pointed out to me during a lab meeting after the paper was published. There is no seam in my microtubule… I’d forgotten about it. A three subunit helical rise in the microtubule means that there should be a point where an alpha tubulin rests laterally against a beta tubulin. I tried to shrug it off - it’s just a model after all, does it really matter? - but this niggled away at me and eventually I re-drew it:

I caved in because [building models matters](http://www.dnaftb.org/19/animation.html ). I’m not a structural biologist, but my undergraduate training nevertheless taught me the value of getting to know a protein structure intimately. Anyway, during the (inevitable) obsessive phase that followed, the idea of microtubules and the cytoskeleton as scaffolds for cell shape took hold. I produced a mock architectural drawing of a microtubule to visually drive home the metaphor of the cytoskeleton as the cells structural bones:

In a fantasy world of endless time to play around in Illustrator, I thought it would be nice to produce a series of these architect-esque drawings. Actin filament branching and the recent work on the [axonal cytoskeleton](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/452.full) would lend themselves well to this format. One day maybe...

What tickles me about the microtubule seam is that you see the same thing in knitting. If you knit a tube with stripes you get (a bit of knitter jargon for you) ‘jogs’. In essence this is a seam generated by a one subunit helical rise. Knitters have a couple of tricks for producing  ‘jogless’ stripes, but the raw form looks like this:

Rest assured, if there is a knitting/cell biology metaphor to be found, I will find it. In the mean time I will impatiently wait for 3D printing from home to become vaguely affordable. I would love to try to design and build a microtubule. There are few things so beautiful in nature as an endless repeating helical pattern.
