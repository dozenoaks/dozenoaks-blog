When I was on the microscope imaging EB3 comets in axons as a control experiment for a control experiment, I got distracted by the comets in the dendrites - so pretty! They reminded me of the icicle lights on the outside of people's houses you see this time of year. So this is my science Christmas card to you - have a Merry one :)
