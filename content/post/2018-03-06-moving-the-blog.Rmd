I moved my blog! Not just in terms of where it's hosted, but how the whole thing
is built. Previously I'd been using [ghost](https://ghost.org/), which was fine up until the moment I wanted to publish more code/analysis. The process of copy-pasting code and exporting images was taking more time than writing the code itself.  

I'm now using the `blogdown` package which builds static websites within RStudio
using Hugo *and* lets you publish the results. The key thing being that you can
publish an R notebook directly from the console where the analysis is written,
while `blogdown` does all the hard (boring) work. I went for the
[GitHub](https://github.com/) -> [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) route to
publishing, as recommended by `blogdown` creator [Yihui
Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/). Given that I have only the vaguest of
notions about how all that works, it was surprisingly straight forward to set up
thanks to really excellent documentation. I'm currently using the
[tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) Hugo theme
and using a sub-domain of the lab website to point to Netlify. This also forced
me to learn to interact with GitHub more sensibly, which has been on my to do
list for about five years - better late than never :)

Handy resources if you're looking to do the same:  

* The blog down book by Yihui Xei et al., [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)  
* Jenny Bryan's intro to GitHub book, [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)

The only gotcha I encountered: the automatically generated .Icon file created by OSX in any new folder halted compilation when I initially rendered my
website locally. This was easily fixed by deleting the file.
